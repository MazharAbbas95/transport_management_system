# Transport Management System (TMS)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Transport Management System (TMS)** is a **console-based C++ application** designed to manage transport operations efficiently.  
It provides secure **Signup & Login**, followed by three main management modules:
- Driver Management
- Trip Management
- Daily Akhrajat (Expenses) Management

This project demonstrates the practical use of **Data Structures**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **menu-driven programming**.
